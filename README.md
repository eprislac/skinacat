<h1>Welcome to the GitHub Repo for Skin a Cat!</h2>
<p>Skin a Cat is a labor of love for me, a sort of legendary undertaking, 
in which I attempt to take several different languages and within them, 
write the same programs over and over.</p> 

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>I'm hoping that in the course of doing this crazy thing, I'll not only 
be sharing my own meager knowlege, I'll also become a better programmer 
in the process. I'll be doing my best to adhere to established Best
Practices and Design Patterns, and to the principles of DRY (Don't Repeat 
Yourself ) Programming, and if I find a better way of doing something 
than the way I've already posted, I'll be sure and update the posted
code to reflect that</p>

<h3>Languages</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Awk</li>
	<li>C</li>

</ul>  
<sub>* NOTE: Every language will not be represented in every project- for 
instance, LifeForm, which is an excersise in object creation, class 
inheritacnce, and interfaces, will concern only object oriented langauges,
while the projects from <a href="projecteuler.org" targe="_blank">Project Euler</a>, which are all math-related, 
will be covered by a broader scope.</sub> 

<h3>Projects</h3>
<ol>
<li>Here kitty kitty...
	<ul>
		<li>Skin a Cat's version of "Hello World", the basic, worthless
"Look, I wrote a program!" program that all programming courses start you out with. So far, we have twenty-three languages covered.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>LifeForm
	<ul><li>An excersise in object creation, class inheritance, and interfaces.</li>
	<li>Also includes unit testing</li></ul>
</li> 
<li>Project Euler
	<ul>
		<li>This is actually a collection of mini-projects presenting math problems from <a href="http://projecteuler.com" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>
, which was the major inspiration for Skin a Cat</li>
		<li>The majority of the languages will be covered, no guarantees that I'll include unit tests, but I'll try.</li>
	</ul>
	
</li>
<li>More to come...</li>
</ul>
