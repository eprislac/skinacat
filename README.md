# Welcome to the GitHub Repo for Skin a Cat! #
Skin a Cat is a labor of love for me, a sort of legendary undertaking,
in which I attempt to take several different languages and within them,
write the same programs over and over.

## Why? #

I'm hoping that in the course of doing this crazy thing, I'll not only be sharing my own meager knowlege, I'll also become a better programmer in the process. I'll be doing my best to adhere to established Best Practices and Design Patterns, and to the principles of __DRY__ (Don't Repeat Yourself) Programming, and if I find a better way of doing something than the way I've already posted, I'll be sure and update the posted code to reflect that


### Projects: #
 - __Here kitty, kitty...__
   - Skin a Cat's version of "Hello World", the basic, worthless, "Look, Mom, I wrote a program!" program that all programming courses start you out with. Twenty-two languages covered, some with multiple examples.
 - __FizzBuzz__
   - Another beginner program, but with a twist... I'm attempting to do it with no if/else structures. Four languages covered so far, with more to come.
 - __Legacy Projects__
   - When I first created this project seven years ago, I had a few other projects I was attempting, which have been (mostly) abandoned. This is due to me no longer having the same dev-env I was using at the time (used to be on Linux, am on Mac now)
      - __LifeForm:__ An excercise in class inheritance, deleted. I was so damned embarrassed of the c-sharp and c++ code when I went back and read it, and have no intention of doing so much php code ever again.
      - __Euler:__ Excersises from [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.com), the main inspiration for this project. I may be picking these back up.

<sub>* __NOTE:__ Every language will not be represented in every project, depends on my level of interest; I get bored easily.</sub>
