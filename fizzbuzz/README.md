## FizzBuzz : Fizzy, Fuzzy, Big and Buzzy #

FizzBuzz is a first-year computing problem many of us have faced. The rules are pretty simple: Given an integer, if the integer is a multiple of three, return 'Fizz', if the integer is a multiple of five, return 'Buzz', if a multiple of both three and five, return 'FizzBuzz', and if it's not a multiple of either, return an empty string. Most folks' go-to in this situation is to whip out a simple `if/else` conditional, but honestly, that's kid-stuff. There's a better way to do it, most of the time, so I'll be attempting to solve FizzBuzz in each language in each case using, if possible, no traditional conditional statements.

Not so! <laughs maniacally> It's not only possible, but in many languages, it's super-easy!
